# CS315-Scheduler

Demo C++ implementation of operating system scheduling algorithms under different running conditions
Both scheduler algorithms have examples to showcase ideal, starved, and random conditions


## Features

- Rate-monotonic and round-robin scheduler algorithms
- Multiple task creation input modes
- Object-oriented code, including inheritance
- Usage of doubly linked lists, vectors, queues, pointers, and dereferencing
- ASCII output interface for usability and debugging
